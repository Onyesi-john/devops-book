# _Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery_ code

This repo contains the sample code for the book and blog post series _Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery_ by 
Yevgeniy Brikman.

## Quick start

The code samples are organized by chapter (e.g., _ch1_, _ch2_, etc.), and within each chapter, by tool (e.g., _ansible_, 
_kubernetes_, _tofu_). For example, the example Packer template in Chapter 2 will be in the folder _ch2/packer_, and 
the example OpenTofu module called `lambda` in Chapter 3 will be in the folder _ch3/tofu/lambda_.

It's worth noting that most of the examples show you what the code looks like at the _end_ of a chapter. If
you want to maximize your learning, you're better off writing the code yourself, from scratch, and checking the
"official" solutions only at the very end.
